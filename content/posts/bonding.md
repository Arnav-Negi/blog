## Community Bonding Period

This period in the gsoc program is when you get to know the org admins, mentors and other fellow contributors.
I had a few meetings with my mentors during this month. In this period I mostly got familiar with the HPX runtime
and got an introduction to the HPC cluster used by HPX - ROSTAM.
