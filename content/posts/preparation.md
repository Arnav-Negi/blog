## Why I chose to do GSoC

GSoC is hosted every year by Google and is a very sought after program for anyone wanting to get into open source. It was my quriosity surrounding open source and will to have something to do during the summers which made me try for GSoC.

## Choosing the organisation

Selecting the correct org can determine the success of your project, and also the chances of your proposal getting selected. Ever since I took the OS course in my uni, I had wanted to explore systems and high performance computing. A senior of mine had contributed to HPX, a C++ library for HPC last year, so I decided to pick this org as well. HPX is a library developed by Ste||ar Group.

## Selecting the idea and writing the proposal

For me this was the hardest part. Ideally you would have some experience with the software you are contributing to, but I had never used HPX before. It took me a couple of days just to figure out how to build and install it :P. After the basics, I selected the project idea about asynchronous I/O. The project idea was on the org's github page and came with a bunch of references. Reading through the references and reading the nightmarish C++ code for it, I sttarted writing my proposal.

## The good bit: getting selected

The results came at 2 am IST and I got to know about my selection from a friend. I was very relieved by this, I finally had something to do during the summer!
